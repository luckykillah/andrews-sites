Adds a simple 'Post-it' widget to the Dashboard that allows you to leave yourself or other authors a note.

== Description ==

Adds a simple 'Post-it' widget to the Dashboard that allows you to leave yourself or other authors a note. The plugin can be configured and moved around as any other Dashboard widget. It will accept plain text or (sanitized) HTML. Only users with the capability "Edit dashboard" can edit the note.

This simple plugin is based on code from [WP Engineer](http://wpengineer.com/add-wordpress-dashboard-widgets/ "Add WordPress Dashboard widgets") and [Ricardo Gonz&aacute;lez Castro](http://rick.jinlabs.com/2009/02/01/how-add-options-to-your-wordpress-27-dashboard-widgets/ "How to add options to your WordPress 2.7 Dashboard widgets").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about multiple instances? =
Although it should be relatively easy to add support for multiple instances of this widget, I am not planning to add such functionality at this time. If you want to contribute some code, do [contact me](http://ideophone.org/dashboard-post-it/ "Dashboard Post-it homepage") and I will consider extending the plugin.

= Can you add feature X? =
This plugin was developed as a solution to one problem. It can no doubt be extended, but probably not by me. I welcome other contributors.
